As a Python expert, generate only the function implementation code based strictly on the provided signature, docstring and hints, without any explanations, tests or additional text.    

### Function signature and docstring
def find_Odd_Pair(A,N):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the pairs with xor as an odd number.
    '''

### Hints
Understand the Input. The function takes a list A and an integer N, where N is the number of elements in the list A.
Understand XOR Properties. The XOR of two numbers is odd if and only if one number is odd and the other is even. Therefore, we need to count how many odd and even numbers are present in the list.
Count Odd and Even Numbers. Initialize two counters: one for odd numbers and one for even numbers. Iterate through the list to populate these counters.
Calculate Pairs. The number of valid pairs (one odd, one even) can be calculated by multiplying the count of odd numbers by the count of even numbers.
Return the Count. Finally, return the total count of such pairs.
Implement the function

### Function implementation
def find_Odd_Pair(A, N):
    count = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if (A[i] ^ A[j]) % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count

You are a Python assistant. You are given function signature and docstring. Provide the full implementation of the following function.
    
### Function signature and docstring
def find_Odd_Pair(A,N):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the pairs with xor as an odd number.
    '''

### Step to implement
To implement the find_Odd_Pair function, we can follow these steps:
Step1: Understand the Input. The function takes a list A and an integer N, where N is the number of elements in the list A.
Step2: Understand XOR Properties. The XOR of two numbers is odd if and only if one number is odd and the other is even. Therefore, we need to count how many odd and even numbers are present in the list.
Step3: Count Odd and Even Numbers. Initialize two counters: one for odd numbers and one for even numbers. Iterate through the list to populate these counters.
Step4: Calculate Pairs. The number of valid pairs (one odd, one even) can be calculated by multiplying the count of odd numbers by the count of even numbers.
Step5: Return the Count. Finally, return the total count of such pairs.
Step6: Implement the function

Question: Write a Python function to count the number of vowels in a given string.
Break it down into sub-questions:
Sub-question1: What defines a vowel in the context of this problem?
Answer to sub-question1: Vowels are typically defined as the characters a, e, i, o, u (case-insensitive). Need to decide whether to include uppercase letters (e.g., A, E) as valid vowels.
Sub-question2: How to iterate through the input string and check each character?
Answer to sub-question2: Loop through each character in the string and determine if it matches any of the predefined vowels. Use a counter variable to track the total number of vowels found.
Sub-question3: How to handle case sensitivity?
Answer to sub-question3: Convert the input string to lowercase (or uppercase) before checking vowels, or explicitly check both lowercase and uppercase versions of vowels.
Sub-question4: What edge cases should be considered?
Answer to sub-question4: Empty strings, strings with no vowels, strings with mixed characters (letters, symbols, numbers), and strings containing uppercase vowels (e.g., "AEIOU").

Question: Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
Break it down into sub-questions:
sub-question1. Understand the Problem and Input Format. What is the input to the function? (e.g., a matrix represented as a list of lists) What is the input to the function? (e.g., a matrix represented as a list of lists) What is the expected output? (e.g., a sorted matrix based on the sum of its rows) Are there any constraints on the matrix size or values?  
sub-question2. Calculate the Sum of Each Row. How do you calculate the sum of elements in a single row of the matrix? How can you compute the sum for all rows in the matrix?  
sub-question3. Sort the Matrix Based on Row Sums. How do you associate each row with its sum? How can you sort the rows of the matrix in ascending order based on their sums?
sub-question4. Define the Function. How do you structure the function in Python? What parameters does the function take? What should the function return?  

Answer to sub-question1: Understand the Problem. The input is a matrix represented as a list of lists. The output is the same matrix, but sorted by the sum of each row in ascending order. There are no specific size constraints, but the matrix typically has rows of the same length.
Answer to sub-question2: Calculate Row Sums. To calculate the sum of each row, use Python's sum() function. To get the sum for all rows, iterate through the matrix and apply sum() to each row.
Answer to sub-question3: Sort the Matrix. Pair each row with its sum. Use Python's sorted() function to sort these pairs based on the row sum. Once sorted, extract the rows back into a new matrix.
Answer to sub-question4: Define the Function. The function should take the matrix as input, compute row sums, sort the rows by sum, and return the sorted matrix.

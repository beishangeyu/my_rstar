First, let's count up how many tires she needs to inflate. From condition 1, we know that she needs to inflate 5 bicycle tires, 3 tricycle tires, and 1 unicycle tire. So in total she needs to inflate 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 tires. Second, condition 2 tells us that each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is 9 times 25 cents, which is 9 / 4 = $2.25.

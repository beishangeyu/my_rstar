Let's first solve the equation 3*Adrian's age = Harriet's age. 3*Adrian's age = Harriet's age. Therefore, Harriet's age = (3 * Adrian's age) / 3 = 3 * Adrian's age. Next, we can solve the equation Harriet's age / 2 = Zack's current age. Harriet's age / 2 = Zack's current age. Therefore, Zack's current age = Harriet's age / 2 = (3 * Adrian's age) / 2 = 3/2 * Adrian's age. Now that we know all the ages, we can find the average age. Average age = (Harriet's age + Adrian's age + Zack's age) / 3 = [(3 * Adrian's age) + Adrian's age + (3/2 * Adrian's age)] / 3 = (9/2 * Adrian's age + Adrian's age) / 3 = (11/2 * Adrian's age) / 3 = (11 * Adrian's age) / 6 = (Adrian's age + Adrian's age) / 6 = 2 * Adrian's age / 6 = Adrian's age / 3.

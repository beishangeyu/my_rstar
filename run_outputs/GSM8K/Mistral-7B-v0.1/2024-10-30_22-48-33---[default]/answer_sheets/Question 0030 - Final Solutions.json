So Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. From condition 2, the sum of their current ages is 162. This means:\nHint 3: Let's use the variables x and y to represent their current ages. Then we can write this as (7x + 11y) = 162. We can solve for y by subtracting 7x from both sides and dividing by 11. Thus we get:\nHint 4: So Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.

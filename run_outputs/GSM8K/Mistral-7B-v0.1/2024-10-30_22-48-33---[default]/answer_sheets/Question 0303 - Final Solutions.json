Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. In the second year, Elise earned 20$ per book. She sold 2 times as many books in the first year as she does now. Since the number of unsold books is 50, she must have sold 100 books in the first year. Thus, she has sold 100 books in the first year minus 50 remaining books is 50 books. She earned 20$ * 50 books = 1000$. To determine the total number of books sold in the first year, we need to know how many books Elise has sold in the first year. Let's call it x.

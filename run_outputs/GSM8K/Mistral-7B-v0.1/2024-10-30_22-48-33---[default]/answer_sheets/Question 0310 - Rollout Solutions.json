To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, let's first calculate the total cost of buying the business suits and suitcases. Theo bought 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the business suits is 6 x $100 = $600. Additionally, Theo bought 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 x $50 = $150. Therefore, the total cost of buying business suits and suitcases is $600 + $150 = $750.

Since the cost of a business suit is $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 x $100 = $500. Hence, the cost of the flight ticket is $700 + $500 = $1200. Finally, let's subtract the amount Theo spent on buying business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the total budget of $6000.

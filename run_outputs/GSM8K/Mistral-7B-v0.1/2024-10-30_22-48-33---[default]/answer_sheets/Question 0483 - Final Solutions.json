Gabriel has 20 songs currently stored on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so he has 3 * 20 = 60 songs currently stored on his player. The difference between the maximum number of songs that Gabriel can add to his player and the maximum number of songs that Luri can add to his player is therefore 100 - 60 = 40.

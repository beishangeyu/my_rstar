Condition 1 says that 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges are purchased from Well's mother's store. Condition 2 says that the cost of a watermelon is thrice as much as the price of each pepper. That means that the cost of a watermelon is equal to 3 times the price of each pepper. This also tells us that the cost of each pepper is equal to 1/3rd of the cost of a watermelon. Since each pepper costs $15, according to condition 4, we can conclude that the cost of each watermelon is $15*3 = $45. Similarly, since the cost of each orange is 5 units lower than the cost of a watermelon, it is equal to $45 - 5 = $40.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, if you know two sides of a right triangle, you can find the length of the third side. In this case, we know the lengths of two sides of the triangle: Stanley to the comb (4,000 feet), and Stanley to Oliver (7,000 feet). We need to find the length of the third side, which is the distance from the comb to Oliver. To find this distance, we can use the formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b represent the lengths of the two known sides, and c represents the length of the unknown side. In our case, a = 4,000 and b = 7,000. So, we have 4000^2 + 7000^2 = c^2. Using some algebra, we can rearrange this equation to solve for c: c = sqrt(4000^2 + 7000^2).

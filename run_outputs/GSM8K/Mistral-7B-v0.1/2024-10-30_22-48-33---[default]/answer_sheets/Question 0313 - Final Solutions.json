Thus, we can calculate the current population of Chile using this equation: p = 3000 * (n-6) = 3000*n - 3000*6 = 3000*46 - 3000*6 = 138000.

We know that the current age of Cera is c, and the current age of Noah is n. 6 years ago, Cera's age was c-6 and Noah's age was n-6. The population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which was (n-6). Therefore, the current population of Chile is 3000 times Noah's age, plus 6 years of growth. This is equal to 3000(n-6) + 6. Putting everything together, we get that the current population of Chile is 3000(c-6) + 6.

To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, let's first calculate the total cost of buying the business suits and suitcases. Theo bought 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the business suits is 6 x $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since the cost of a business suit is $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 x $100 = $500. Hence, the cost of the flight ticket is $700 + $500 = $1200.

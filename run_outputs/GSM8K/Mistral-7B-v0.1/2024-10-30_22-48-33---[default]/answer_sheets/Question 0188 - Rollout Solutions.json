First, we need to find the total cost of the wheat bags bought by the trader. The problem says that the trader bought the wheat bags at a rate of $20 per bag. So, the total cost would be $20 times the number of bags bought. Let's say the trader bought n bags of wheat. Then, the total cost would be $20n. Next, we need to add the cost of transporting the wheat bags to the warehouse. The problem says that it costs $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost for transport would be $2 times the number of bags bought. Therefore, the total cost of transportation would be $2n. Finally, we need to add the total cost of buying and transporting the wheat bags to the trader's total profit. The problem says that the trader made a total profit of $400. So, the total cost would be $400. Now, we can solve the equation. We know that the total cost of the wheat bags bought by the trader plus the cost of transporting them to the warehouse plus the trader's total profit equals $400. We can write this as an equation. $20n + $2n + $400 = $400. Simplifying this, we get 22n = $400. Dividing both sides by 22, we get n = 18. This means that the trader bought 18 bags of wheat.

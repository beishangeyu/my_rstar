To find the difference between the salaries, we need to calculate the net pay for each job. Let's start with Job A. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. This means the gross pay for Job A is $30,000. But we also need to factor in the 20% total tax rate, so the net pay for Job A is $30,000 x (1 - 0.2) = $24,000. Next, let's look at Job B. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. To calculate the net pay for Job B, we first deduct the property tax from the salary: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, we apply the 10% tax rate to this amount: $36,000 x (1 - 0.1) = $32,400. Finally, we subtract the net pay for Job A ($24,000) from the net pay for Job B ($32,400), which results in a difference of $8,400.

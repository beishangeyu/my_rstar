First condition says 30% of sales less than or equal to 1000 is the base commission. Second condition says 10% of anything above 1000. Third condition says sales is 2500. Base commission for sales less than or equal to 1000 is 30% of 1000 which is 300. 10% of 2500 minus 1000 is (2500 - 1000) / 100 * 10 which is 1500/100 * 10 which is 150.

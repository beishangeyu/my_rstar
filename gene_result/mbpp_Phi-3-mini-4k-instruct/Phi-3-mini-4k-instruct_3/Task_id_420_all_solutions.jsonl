Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. Initialize the sum variable:\nThe function starts by initializing a variable called `cube_sum` to store the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. This variable is set to zero initially.\n\n2. Loop through the first n even numbers:\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate through the first n even numbers. The range function is used to generate a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive). The loop starts at 2 (the first even number) and increments by 2 in each iteration.\n\n3. Calculate the cube of the current even number:\nInside the loop, the function calculates the cube of the current even number (i) using the exponentiation operator (**). The cube of a number is the result of raising it to the power of 3.\n\n4. Add the cube to the sum:\nThe function adds the calculated cube to the `cube_sum` variable using the addition assignment operator (+=). This step accumulates the sum of the cubes of the even numbers.\n\n5. Return the final sum:\nAfter the loop completes, the function returns the `cube_sum` variable, which now contains the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers.\n\nThe function takes an integer argument `n` representing the number of even natural numbers to consider. The function returns an integer representing the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\n>>> cube_Sum(2)\n72\n```\n\nIn this example, the function calculates the cube sum of the first 2 even natural numbers (2 and 4). The cubes of these numbers are 8 and 64, respectively, and their sum is 72.", "value": 0.03125}}}, "rollout_id": 3, "type": "DIRECT_ANSWER"}
